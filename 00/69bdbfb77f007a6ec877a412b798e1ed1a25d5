Good catch!

Note: during the development of this new version, I went from `setXxx()` to `xxx()` and back to `setXxxx()` multiple times ... I settled for `setXxx()` because, although it's a bit boring, creates more consistent naming (with `xxx()` names, sometimes you have verbs and sometimes names ... some are expressive and some are confusing ... `setXxx()` solves all those problems).
