Update:
 * All default DBAL types have a filter type, except `binary`.
 * If the user doesn't give the filter type and its options, then they are guessed thanks to `DoctrineOrmFilterTypeGuesser`.
 * Some bugs have been fixed in the meantime.

**Last Update:**
Now you can register an alias (shortcut or short name) for your custom filter type (optional!!):
```yaml
services:
    App\Form\Filter\BlogPostStatus:
        tags: [{ name: 'easyadmin.filter.type', alias: 'blogpost_status' }]
```
This is an example for a `string` field whose default filter type is` TextFilterType`:
```yaml
easy_admin:
    entities:
        Category:
            class: App\Entity\BlogPost
            list:
                filters:
                    - property: 'status'
                      type: 'blogpost_status'
```
In addition, there is a shortcut for each built-in filter type: boolean, text, textarea, integer, decimal, float, date, time, datetime, dateinterval and array.

I've reviewed this ... and I can't really add anything ... just clap üëè with admiration at Yonel's work! Thanks!!

I'm going to merge this "as is" and then I'll open a minor PR with very minor tweaks for some things.
