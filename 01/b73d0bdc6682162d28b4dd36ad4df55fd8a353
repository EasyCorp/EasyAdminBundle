@grachevko it's a privileges of @javiereguiluz exclusively as owner of this bundle. From my experience, Javier likes to first discuss the idea, approve it and then, if it is accepted, implement it. But I am sure he will analyze your proposal as soon as possible ;) He has a great plan for this bundle https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/projects/1 may have some priorities.
