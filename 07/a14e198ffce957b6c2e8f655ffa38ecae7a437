I didn't know that you could use in `include:` some values that weren't part of the matrix variables. In this case, we only list `ubuntu-latest` in the `os` variable ... but then we use `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` too as the values of some jobs. That's nice!

@OleksiiBulba thanks for proposing these changes and thanks @asispts for reviewing them ðŸ™Œ
