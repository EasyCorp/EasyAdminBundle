I understand your PR and I thank you for that .... but I wanted to reorganize tests, so I don't know if this PR is beneficial. This is what I want to do:

* Create a plain configuration file and an associated functional test to check the values of the default backend (this is essential for EasyAdmin newcomers)
* Create a 100% customized configuration (change every field, label, action, etc.) and create an associated functional test to check the values of the customized backends (this is essential for EasyAdmin experts).

And in the future I'd like to follow this same workflow: create the minimal specific configuration file to test something and load that config file only in one specific functional tests.

@javiereguiluz : No problem. I think what you plan to achieve will be great, indeed.
