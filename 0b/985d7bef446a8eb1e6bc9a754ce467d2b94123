Ah. The issue is, that symfony/expression-language is not required in EasyAdmin's composer.json file.
Not sure if you want to add this as regular dependency. I would add it as dev-dependency first.

The remaining issue
```
  40     Call to function is_array() with Doctrine\Common\Lexer\Token|null
         will always evaluate to false.
```
seems not be caused by my changes.
Because you do not provide a composer.lock file, it has updated doctrine/orm to 2.18.0 - which probably causes this issue.
