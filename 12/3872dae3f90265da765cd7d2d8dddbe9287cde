Hi @javiereguiluz
Can you provide me an exemple to install the fork with composer ?
My attempts failed:
```sh
!!  2020-05-06T20:22:18+00:00 [critical] Uncaught Error: Class 'EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\EasyAdminBundle' not found
```
But the vendor was there...

In cases like this, what I do is to copy + paste the app.js contents of this PR into the same file inside the vendor/ folder of my app ðŸ™ˆ

Thanks, I did the test with a log to be sure the right file is load.
It's ok for me!
If you have a link of an article to test PR with composer, I will have a look ðŸ˜‰ it could be help full ðŸ˜…
