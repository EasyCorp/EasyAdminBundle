Hi @ksn135 ,

Just with this small add Line of code you have a complete Ajax system ?

Could you add a complete example if possible ?

Thanks in advance :)

This looks very nice. I wonder if we should add this as a built-in feature in EA ü§î

@javiereguiluz well, it looks VERY promising, BUT with my current setup it's has several glitches:
* When exception occurs it stalled with exception page (needs browser reload)
* Symfony toolbar not updated properly (probably need additional setup in ```containers ```)

It's OK for production, but I've disabled it in development mode for now. )

@ksn135 May be an option to disable / enable it,
It's look very nice when I test it on my project

@javiereguiluz could be a nice feature :)

I'm strictly against any PR from a Russian who seems to work for the entertainment industry of a criminal warfare country.

It's PURE discrimination against Russians based on their ethnic or cultural origin, typical forms of [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia) and [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism).

GitHub‚Äôs vision is to be the home for all developers, no matter where they reside. We take our obligations with respect to government mandates seriously, which includes complying with stringent new export controls aimed at severely restricting Russia‚Äôs access to technologies and other items needed to sustain its aggressive military capabilities.

We also take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond the scope of the mandates. This includes protecting open collaboration and the free flow of information in our interconnected community to support communications, humanitarian work, and organizing for change. You can read more about [GitHub policies](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-and-trade-controls) on GitHub Docs.

i think if we use turbo for the feel of spa experience is a better way than swup
