Not sure what your intentions are, but re-reading the template:

```
{% if app.user %}
    {{ app.user.username|default('user.unnamed'|trans(domain = 'EasyAdminBundle')) }}
{% else %}
    {{ 'user.anonymous'|trans(domain = 'EasyAdminBundle') }}
{% endif %}
```

It looks like you want to support anonymous users. So, not sure if making security bundle a requirement is the right path.

In theory, the security bundle shouldn't be mandatory. In practice it's hard to imagine a backend without security protection, so I'm totally üëç about this PR.

Regarding the template code, we included a lot of safeguards here and there to make sure the backend never fails when some features are not enabled. We wanted to make the bundle setup as simple as possible.

This safeguard does not work as `app.user` throws an exception if security bundle is not enabled.

There are other means than the security bundle in order to secure the backend access (the infrastructure for instance). I think that's why anonymous users were allowed at first. However, I can't find any related comment about this decision. There is only [this issue](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/issues/749) mentioning anonymous users.

So maybe it's better to fix the template ?
