I'm glad you did not set the `menu` option in this PR because I think that the menu should not be under `design`, but directly under the root node.

Everything sounds well to me

@Pierstoval I'm leaving the `menu` thing until the end on purpose. Meanwhile we'll be able to discuss about it.

Everything seems well, I think you can merge this !

The BC break convenience is really good !
