Awesome !!

Does it work with `multiple` selects?

@Pierstoval yes, the widget works with multiple selects ... but our bundle does not because we don't support many-to-many relations :cry: That is my top-priority feature in my list right now.

Actually, many-to-many should work normally with multiple selects :confused:

I don't understand yor last comment. Anyway, this PR is in fact "a trojan horse", because Select2 also supports autocompletion and AJAX-loading ... which is another feature that I'd like to provide sooner than later.

@javiereguiluz : Also, we should be able to choose which widget to use. Sometime checkboxes or radio buttons might be more appropriated.
But we talked about all of those problematics in the mentioned issue :smile:
