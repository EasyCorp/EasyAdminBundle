Thanks for this contribution!

I was thinking of this feature as optional, so actions could define an option (e.g. `ask_confirm`) which defaults to `false` (except for the `delete` batch action, which defaults to `true`). If this option is `true`, the modal is displayed.

@fsoedjede I haven't looked at this in detail ... but do you think that adding this option could be possible without complicating things much? Thanks.

Thanks for the reply.

I think it's possible.
When digging into the code, one question comes to me. Should `ask_confirm` be added to the default action config array (see: https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/master/src/Configuration/ActionConfigPass.php#L14)?
For me, it should but that would mean implementing the functionality for each action. Maybe in another PR as this on is excepted to be only about batch actions?

I will make a proposal adding `ask_confirm` to the default action config and if it's not ok, I will made the changes following your guidance.

Edit: I've updated the PR. You can check when you have some time. Thanks
