I think this is necessary before #5209, as a clean structure might help with drag and drop support.

Quentin, thanks for this.

If you need help about rebuilding assets, it's just a matter of running these two commands:

```
$ yarn encore production
$ php src/Resources/bin/fix-assets-manifest-file.php
```

I can do it for you after merging your PR if you want. Thanks

Won't be available until Monday, so I'll let you decide if you want that merged before or after ðŸ˜‰

Assets have been rebuilt, unfortunately creating a `manifest.json` conflict. I guess running the two commands again will fix that.
