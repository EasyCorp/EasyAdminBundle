Important notice: we don't make political decisions in this project ... so we need an independent and reliable source indicating that this change is correct.

So, I looked for in the Wikipedia and found this:

* "Guadeloupe [...] has no flag with official status other than the French national flag." ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Guadeloupe))
* "Martinique has no official flag. The flag of France, its parent country, is the only flag flown with official standing." ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Martinique))

So, this change seems correct and I'm going to merge it. Thanks!
