Hello,
have you considered adding PHPStan as part of your CI build?

@ondrejmirtes not yet because I've just started testing it and we already use other analyzers (Scrutinizer, SensioLabsInsight and PHP-CS-Fixer). But I'm looking into your project and its evolution to eventually add it. Thanks for contributing PHPStan to the community!
