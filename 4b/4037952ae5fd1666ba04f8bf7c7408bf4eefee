I've tested this in a real application and it works ... but a lot of tests are failing because somehow this doesn't work in tests. If I do a `var_dump($this->client->getResponse());` in the first failing test `ActionOverrideTest::testEditViewActions()` I can't see any action in the generated HTML.

**Update**: for some reason, the changes now don't work in the real application either. Not sure why because your changes look right to me ðŸ˜•
