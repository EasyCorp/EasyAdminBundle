Failure is unrelated. See #1419

Require merges https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/1419 then everything will be in green. Why not one PR (ALL IN ONE)? :)

Because the 2 issues are well identified. We know the AppVeyor failure is only due to what is fixed in #1419.

This PR is an enhancement, whereas the second one is a fix ^^

@ogizanagi thanks for fixing this. I've dared to propose new CS rules. If you can, please tell me what you think about them. Thanks!
