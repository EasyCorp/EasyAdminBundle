I'd like to also add `symfony/validator` as a dependency even if this is not strictly needed. WDYT?

Thanks for fixing the missing dependency!

About adding validator too, in theory it wouldn't be needed (well, we use it once in 1 test) ... but in practice I think it should be required: you can't really create a backend without validating the data.

Validator added as a required dependency.
