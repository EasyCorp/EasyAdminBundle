I found the following things in a project, some might not be related to the update.
- To enable the bootstrap dark color mode, we need to set the `data-bs-theme="dark"` for the body element here. https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/4537990112b08d090465a37c1f78b31ecb9e98c6/assets/js/page-color-scheme.js#L53-L56
- Noticed a missing border radius in the trix editor, which causes the overlap of an inner element over the border.

  Can be fixed by
  ```
  trix-toolbar {
    border-top-left-radius: var(--border-radius);
    border-top-right-radius: var(--border-radius);
  }
  ```
  in file https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/4537990112b08d090465a37c1f78b31ecb9e98c6/assets/css/form-type-text-editor.css#L16
- The checkbox doesn't get updated by clicking on the text, but the checkbox changed and opened the inputs. (Looks like this works only with `label` tag and the `for` attribute)
- And the space between the filter inputs is missing.

-  Also here I noticed a missing border-radius. (The dialog and the dropdown)

@chapterjason thanks for your great review ðŸ™‡

I fixed all the issues that you pointed (and you are right, some of those issues happened before the update to Bootstrap 5.3).

The only pending thing is:

> _"The checkbox doesn't get updated by clicking on the text, but the checkbox changed and opened the inputs. (Looks like this works only with label tag and the for attribute)"_

I think that the current behavior is "correct" ... you click on the label but that doesn't check the checkbox ... only opens/closes the filter. If you select any option or type anything or click on anything inside the filter, then the filter it's checked automatically. Thanks.
