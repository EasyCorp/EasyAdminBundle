I'm sorry this translation is wrong ... but this file comes directly from select2 repo and we copy it automatically to the `src/Resources/public/select2/` dir using Webpack:

https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/811f2492d65598e7ec65af62ab34838e10bf8655/webpack.config.js#L19-L26

If we merge this, the change will be overridden next time we update the assets ðŸ¤”  Maybe updating the assets (or only select2 asst if we prefer) solves this?

I'm sorry. I missed that. I thought this was for 2.x only. Let's merge it. Thanks!
