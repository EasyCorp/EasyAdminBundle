What do you think about moving the initialisation of the property to `loadBackendConfig()` too? That method already deals with caching the config and then the whole lazy loading would be in one place.

And what about doing this change for 1.x too?

I agree about moving the logic. Done in 241e0ec.

About 1.x version, it already has that code: https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/aa306230277fbed92c81fbcf4000144aac3eecba/src/Configuration/ConfigManager.php#L66-L68
