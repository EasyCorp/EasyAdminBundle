I would also propose to prepend the locale to the route path in the routing file, which sounds much better to me (I always use this prefix in multi-lang apps, it's very cool)

:+1: . I still think the event listener is better for decoupling & testability purpose (if the logic is more complex and is worth testing). The performance impact is insignificant (of course it'll depend on your app, but in most cases, insignificant).
But for the record, this tip is perfect as it is in the EasyAdmin documentation !

I like @Pierstoval suggestion too, but not sure it suits an admin backend (it's more a SEO thing). Instead I would rather see a language selector in the backend than dealing with the locale in the url (I'm not saying EasyAdmin should implement it, just allow to do it, and I think the `header_menu` and `header_footer` twig blocks allow to to that).

@ogizanagi It's not "only" a SEO thing, it's also much easier to do in development terms because adding the `_locale` parameter in any route will automatically set it up in the translator, and also, creating a "language toggler" in the menu becomes much easier because you can reuse all parameters of the current request and only change the `_locale` option.
Indeed this parameter can be in the query string, but this is ugly, and does not update the translator.
