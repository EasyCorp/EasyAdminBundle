Icon and text are not vertically aligned

After :

Icon and text are vertically aligned

It's not obvious but with my designer's eye, I see it ðŸ˜„

Thanks @MrAnyx. I can't check it now because I'm on a mobile but we might need to use a flex-start + some top padding instead of flex-center ... because sadly it's not uncommon to have some menu items that span more than 1 line because they are very long

Alright, no problems, thanks for your feedback. The solution I proposed is not the most optimal one, I'm still starting in the world of open-source contribution.
