We need to make sure this bug https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/issues/1011 doesn't happen again :/ ?

Although I think that at that time the problem was for the second parameter, which is `true` by default.

The error in this PR was in fact unrelated to the proposed change (it was a misconfiguration in a test) ... so this change looks OK now. @yceruto you are right about being careful with the second parameter ... but as you said, the default value is now `true`, so we don't have to pass it as `true` explicitly. Thanks!
