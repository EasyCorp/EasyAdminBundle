`isSnakeCaseProtectedPropertyWithIsserWithoutHasserWithoutGetterWithoutSetter`
Omg, this is harsh :stuck_out_tongue:

I'm :+1: for this feature, but have to wait until the build succeeds :D

@Pierstoval the word you are looking for is "repugnant". I don't like it at all, but the test does it job and it's useful for the bundle, so I won't look back :)

The test suite already passes, except for this error with `deps = low`:

```
PHP Warning:  Unexpected character in input:  '' (ASCII=18) state=0 in

```

@javiereguiluz : see my comment about this issue: https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/438#issuecomment-138384007
However, it's actually strange we didn't get this issue before with the current `composer.json` :confused:

@ogizanagi thanks for the info. I'll take care of it in the other PR about tweaking the dependencies.
