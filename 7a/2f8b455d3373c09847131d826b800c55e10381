I thank you for this PR ... but I don't fully understand the problem behind this proposal. Do you think this could be a security or serious problem ... or is it just to avoid developers mistakes?

It'll basically make it so any html tags entered in the page_title block are always removed, regardless of if the developer remembered to or not

Yes, allowing things like that:

Notice the `page_title` is an HTML snippet above the form, but is plain text in the `<title>`.

Personally I don't really see any harm in merging this
