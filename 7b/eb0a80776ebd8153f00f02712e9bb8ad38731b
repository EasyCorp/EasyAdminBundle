What about adding php-cs-fixer to CI to prevent these issues?

@TomasVotruba yes, that's the best solution. In the past we had php-cs-fixer enabled in Travis. But one day stopped working and we can't fix it. There is an open issue explaining this and asking for help to the community: https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/issues/721
