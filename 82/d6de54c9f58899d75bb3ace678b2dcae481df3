There should be a CSS style to fix this error for dates:

![select_margin](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/12624183/fd253e38-c52d-11e5-8d00-6067e1976c12.png)

Anyway, I'm going to merge your pull request because I don't understand why we should apply these styles. Thanks for the fix and for your first contribution!
