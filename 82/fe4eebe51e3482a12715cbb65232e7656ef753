Not sure if that really makes sense. Are you able to make this comparison with Opcache enabled?

No matter how low it is, I think if should be taken into account. :+1:

@xabbuh yes, the tests were done with OpCache enabled (and Twig extension enabled too).

The entire page loads in 86ms, so we can't really save a lot. And the four slowest elements are Composer and Twig, which are a bit out of our control:
