I must confess that I did this on purpose ... but thanks to your pull request I realized that I was wrong.

The font size of the site name automatically adapts to its length. If you use `ACME` you'll see a big and beautiful site name and if you use `ACME Megacorp` you'll see it in small letters. However, if your site name is really long, the font size no longer changes and the overflow text is lost.

I'm going to test this change in my backends and I'll merge it ASAP. Thanks.

I've found a big problem in this proposal :cry:  It works perfectly for long names ... but it breaks the design for short names. The first alternative solution I can think of is using an image as the site name. The other one is using the following markup:

```yaml
easy_admin:
    site_name: '<div style="line-height: 1.3">My Company <br/> Our Project</div>'
```

What do you think of these solutions? Do you know any alternative CSS solution that we could use to keep both long and short names vertically centered? Thanks.

When you talk about centering the text vertically, you mean relative to what?

Because the goal of the `padding: 20px 10px;` is the best solution for this.

Plus, changing the `line-height` does not center anything vertically.

Here is how it renders:

When using your CSS, I get these results:

### Long Project Name

It only looks right in the > 1200px and > 1024 resolutions

### Short Project Name (~ 99% of use cases)

It only looks right in the > 1200px resolution

Hmm ... You're right, I'm gonna update this PR to fix responsive issues

Heya, sorry for being soooo late on this PR, but I totally refactored it, and now it works for every responsive mode, with multiline text and images.

BUT, this does not support more than 3 lines of text in responsive mode. 2-lines are showed very well, one line is completely centered, and images fit all necessary sizes automatically.

Bonus: I also found a bug in the definition of the "long" class in the header logo `<a>` tag.

@Pierstoval thanks for working on this. I really appreciate it. Sadly, the last version doesn't work right on my computer using the demo application.

**For SHORT names** the four breakpoints work perfectly:

**For LONG names** it doesn't look right:

![long_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/7615820/64dc01b0-f9a0-11e4-93b0-6beab45b76ad.png)

Am I doing something wrong?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything seems to work well in your screenshots.

There is no default support for "long" names in desktop, because we would need a letter-wrapping.
On mobile/tablet, the long name is simply modifying the width of its container, naturally.
I think we cannot have a "generic" function for this, because the design on mobile/tablet is restricted in height, and the design in desktop is restricted in width...

Maybe @ogizanagi you can find a better idea ? :)

@Pierstoval excuse me because I'm completely stupid. Your PR fixes the issue with **multiline** site names, not with **very long** names. I've tested it with multi-line names and it works perfectly:

![multiline_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/7620821/a5cadf44-f9c2-11e4-861d-e82177a21d18.png)

![multiline_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/7620825/a9b3ed30-f9c2-11e4-87d7-102487e887e5.png)

I'm going to merge it right now. Thanks a lot for working on this. I really appreciate it.
