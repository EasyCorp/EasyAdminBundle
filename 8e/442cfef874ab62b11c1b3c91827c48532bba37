From my side it's finished. I had to add a second commit which partly reverses https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/commit/9205a18163331f8a243305a416c3568647f2cc55 for compatibility with Symfony 5.4.

I can do another PR (without tests) for the branch `3.x` if wanted.

I would like to rework this a little (tests and also check again if everything makes sense). But before I want to wait if https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/5054 gets merged because it refactors the tests a little.

Ok, from my side this is finished now :)

This PR also would replace https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/pull/5047.
