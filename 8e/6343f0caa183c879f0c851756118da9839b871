@javiereguiluz I've a commit that fix BC for SF <= 2.7 in this form type:
```php
$form->add('autocomplete', 'Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Form\Type\EntityType', $options);
```
I wish reuse [this code](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/blob/master/Form/Type/EasyAdminFormType.php#L133-L199) but is necessary refactorization one. The question is, I should  submit this refactor in this PR? or separate one?

When will this nice feature released?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by yceruto at 2016-04-08T11:39:33Z

@javiereguiluz I've fixed an issue. Now, we can clear the autocomplete value (tested with `multiple` option too).

I was testing the latest changes of this PR before merging it ... and suddenly everything stopped working ðŸ˜­  The autocomplete fields no longer works for me:

![autocomplete](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/14403181/ff94ea20-fe4d-11e5-955f-194eddd3c3a1.gif)

I'll check in detail later today to see if it's my fault.

I'm sorry but I cannot make this work. It worked great in the past ... but now the autocomplete field doesn't work for me. Can someone reproduce this error? Just use the Symfony Demo app and change the Category entity to use the autocomplete type:

```yaml
easy_admin:
    entities:
        Category:
            class: AppBundle\Entity\Category
            # ...
            form:
                fields:
                    # ...
                    - { property: 'parent', type: 'easyadmin_autocomplete' }
```

Updated following the @ogizanagi comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that once this PR is merged or rebased on master, the `easyadmin-all.min.js` file needs to be re-built.
