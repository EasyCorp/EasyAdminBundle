Another issue IMO was the `EntityMetadataInspector` constructor typehinting `Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\ManagerRegistry` instead of `Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\Registry`, which is what is really injected when using the `doctrine` service. That explains the wrong import of `ClassMetadata` in the first place.
