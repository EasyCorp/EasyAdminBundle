As always, I'm glad to help :smile:

Users should keep in mind that overriding an originally declared action with a `@Route` annotation should redeclare this annotation: as you did [here](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/tutorials/tips-and-tricks.md#use-a-custom-dashboard-as-the-index-page-of-the-backend).

Your comment is very important. I've just added a note in 990d338

Good, this should be the main entry point in customizing the backend :)

@javiereguiluz : To be consistent, as you [specified the `admin/` prefix in `routing.yml`](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/318/files#diff-d67879fe0ef179dc5f9ccf642085891cR56), I think you should change `admin` by `/` [here](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/318/files#diff-c1f1e6773cdba6b2c621b1283800b1d7R82). What do you think ?

I fully agree! Thanks.

The advantage of merging is that it needs 2 consecutive clicks :D
