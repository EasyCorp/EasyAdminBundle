@tpatartmajeur thanks for fixing this bug! We had reports about this ... but I wasn't sure about it because I'm using this in one of my own apps and it's working. I don't know why it's working, but it is ðŸ¤”  In any case, and even I could be wrong, your fix definitely looks like the right thing to do. Thanks!
