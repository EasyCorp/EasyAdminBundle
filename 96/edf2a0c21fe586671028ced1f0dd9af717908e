Filters are only used here:
https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/423c7f3b2dfd8fd3204bbe43a97390c4169d1d39/src/Orm/EntityRepository.php#L50-L52
Which is only used by `createIndexQueryBuilder`.
And `createIndexQueryBuilder` is only used by `index` and `autocomplete` actions in `AbstractCrudController`.
So this PR seems to have no edge effect.

@javiereguiluz what's your take on this ?

It's related to your issue but it won't fix it.
This PR will only allow to keep the querystring "filters".
We should discuss about how querystring should be handled, what's a good practice and what's not.
