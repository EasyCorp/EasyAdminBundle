#### Demo Application

[easy-admin-demo](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/easy-admin-demo) is a simple
Symfony application created to showcase EasyAdmin features.

Installation
------------

### Step 1: Download the Bundle

```bash
$ composer require javiereguiluz/easyadmin-bundle
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new JavierEguiluz\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\EasyAdminBundle(),
        );
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Step 3: Load the Routes of the Bundle

```yaml
# app/config/routing.yml
easy_admin_bundle:
    resource: "@EasyAdminBundle/Controller/"
    type:     annotation
    prefix:   /admin

# ...
```

### Step 4: Prepare the Web Assets of the Bundle

```cli
php app/console assets:install --symlink
```

That's it! Now everything is ready to create your first admin backend.

Your First Backend
------------------

Creating your first backend will take you less than 30 seconds. Let's suppose
that your Symfony application defines three Doctrine ORM entities called
`Customer`, `Order` and `Product`.

Creating the backend for those entities just require you to add the following
configuration in the `app/config/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
easy_admin:
    entities:
        - AppBundle\Entity\Customer
        - AppBundle\Entity\Order
        - AppBundle\Entity\Product
```

**Congratulations! You've just created your first fully-featured backend!**
Browse the `/admin` URL in your Symfony application and you'll get access to
the admin backend:

![Default listing interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/master/Resources/doc/images/easyadmin-list-view.png)

Creating a backend is that simple because EasyAdmin doesn't generate any code.
All resources are served on-the-fly to ensure an exceptional developer
experience.

Without any further configuration, EasyAdmin guesses the best settings to make
your admin backend look "good enough". This may be acceptable for simple
backends and rapid prototypes, but most of the times, you need to customize
some parts of the backend. Keep reading the rest of the documentation to learn
how to do it.
