Chapter 7. Customizing the Search Action
========================================

Currently, the `search` action uses the same configuration as the `list`

The main shortcoming of the `search` action is that you cannot configure the
fields on which the search query is performed. EasyAdmin will soon allow you
to configure some of these features.
