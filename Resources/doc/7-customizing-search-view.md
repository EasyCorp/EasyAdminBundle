Chapter 7. Customizing the Search View
======================================

Currently, the `search` view uses the same configuration as the `list` view

The main shortcoming of the `search` view is that you cannot configure the
fields on which the search query is performed. EasyAdmin will soon allow you
to configure some of these features.
