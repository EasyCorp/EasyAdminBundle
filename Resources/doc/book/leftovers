Customize the Label of the Main Menu Items
------------------------------------------

By default, main menu items display the name of their associated entity. If you
want to customize any menu item, define the `label` option of its related entity:

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
easy_admin:
    entities:
        Customers:
            label: 'Active Clients'
            class: AppBundle\Entity\Customer
        Orders:
            label: 'Pending Orders'
            class: AppBundle\Entity\Order
```




      * `image`, displays inline images in the `list`, `search` and `show` views
        (as explained later in this chapter).
      * `toggle`, displays a boolean value as a flip switch in the `list` and
        `search` views (as explained later in this chapter).
      * `raw`, displays the value unescaped (using the `raw` Twig filter), which
        is useful when the content stores HTML code that must be rendered
        instead of displayed as HTML tags (as explained later in this chapter).
