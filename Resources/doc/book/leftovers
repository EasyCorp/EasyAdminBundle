Customize the Label of the Main Menu Items
------------------------------------------

By default, main menu items display the name of their associated entity. If you
want to customize any menu item, define the `label` option of its related entity:

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
easy_admin:
    entities:
        Customers:
            label: 'Active Clients'
            class: AppBundle\Entity\Customer
        Orders:
            label: 'Pending Orders'
            class: AppBundle\Entity\Order
```
