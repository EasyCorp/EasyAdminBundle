# TEST
# when using a built-in action in the entity "actions" configuration, all its
# default options must be maintained (e.g. the "icon" or "css_class" should
# not be lost when the user doesn't define them) unless they are explicitly set,
# even when using null or empty strings (which is useful to remove default values)
