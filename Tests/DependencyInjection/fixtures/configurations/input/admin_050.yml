# TEST
# global backend actions remove all default actions for the 'edit' view
# even if the 'list' action is removed from the backend configuration, the
# resulting view configuration will include it because the 'list' action
# is mandatory for all views and all entities

# CONFIGURATION

            ['-delete', '-list']
