I think that's the only exception we should care. Maybe we should even check the exception error code (1049 - Unknown database) because this can probably hide other issues when the database exists otherwise.

@ogizanagi I was going to restrict this to `1049` error, but then I looked up a bit about PDO errors and found several of them that could also occur:

* 1045: Access denied for user '%s'@'%s' (using password: %s)
* 1049: Unknown database '%s'
* 2005: Unknown MySQL server host '%s' (%d)
* 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on '%s' (%d)
* etc.

So maybe it's better to not check the exception code?

@javiereguiluz : Fair enough, I think you're right :) üëç
