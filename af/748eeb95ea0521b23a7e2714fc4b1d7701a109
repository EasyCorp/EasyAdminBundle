Hi @malteschlueter,

I have tried to reproduce what you are aiming to do

- I was able to make the sidebar configuration to work
- but not the main content part

* Can you provide some documentation about how to make it work and what result we are supposed to see ?
* I have created a reproducer sampe here to ease the testing  https://github.com/tcheymol/easy-admin-content-width-configure/tree/main

Hii @tcheymol,

thanks for your reply.

Normally the layout looks like this and you can switch between the different width of the sidebar with a click between the sidebar and the content (you will see a different pointer at the correct position). To change the content width the action is positioned on the right side of the content.

In a project were I'm actually working on it's a better user experience to use the full width for the content. This will work if you use `->setContentWidth(Crud::CONTENT_WIDTH_FULL)` on a dashboard or CRUD Controller. This will look like this.

If you also add `->setSidebarWidth(Crud::SIDEBAR_WIDTH_COMPACT)` the default will look like this.

The main idea for this PR is that it isn't directly visible that you can change the content width and in my case i want to provide the users direct a good usage experience. A colleague of me made me aware of it after I was a little bit annyoed about how difficult is to read the information on the index pages.^^
I also think that the normal daily user (not developer) who is using easyadmin won't recognize that it's possible to change the layout for yourself.

I recognized now that I still need to update the documentation.
