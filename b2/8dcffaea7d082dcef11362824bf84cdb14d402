After reading your comments, I've decided to redesign the feature. Now it looks like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/60683311-6bf55000-9e97-11e9-8c39-a992b793ae3d.png)

I think it's a good balance between security and utility:

* We only display the "hidden results" message once, no matter how many results you can't see.
* We don't tell you how many results you can't see.
* The message is always displayed at the end of the listing, to not bother much.
* Thanks to this message, the user can (hopefully) understand why the number of results don't match exactly.

It's a little better now, but it still has the security problem:
> You could search by some term or filter by some field/value, discovering the values ​​of the hidden row.

If the message "hidden results" appears, it means that the hidden rows have that value.

What you said is right ... but how could we do it otherwise? I think it's fair to tell the user that there is more information that they can't see because of permissions. Also, we're talking about backends here, so people can complaint/ask to their workmates about this.

I've redesigned the feature again 🙄  It now looks like this:

![easyadmin-list-hidden-results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/60739538-96f8a600-9f62-11e9-836b-0d9b3e0c84d5.png)

About the feature, even some concerns from Yonel are true, I think generally speaking is OK. This will be used in a backend with restricted control where only the employees of the same company will use and see the information. I think it's OK to hide some results ... and to tell the user that some information is hidden.

I'd like to merge this feature "as is" ... and reconsider some decisions with the feedback from users. I hope all of you understand this decision 🙏  Thanks!
