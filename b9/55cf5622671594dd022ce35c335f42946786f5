I don't care much about PHP 5.3 because soon this bundle will only support PHP 7.1 and Symfony 4 ... but it'd be great if someone could look into why tests are now failing in Travis CI with PHP 5.3. Thanks!

But I added class_exists checks everywhere to not use that class in PHP 5.3. Maybe I did something wrong. Can you please help me? Thanks!
