So far the results are promising. Tests now take 30 minute less to complete:

Randomly? Seriously? I think we need coverage on each build :confused:

@Pierstoval code coverage barely changes from one commit to another, so I think it's OK to calculate it "from time to time". Don't you think saving 30 minutes in the test suite is worth it?

Why not adding a dedicated build in the `allow_failure` section, so we can have the result of the required builds on Github without being annoyed by the coverage build ?

@ogizanagi good idea! I'm trying to do that in 90a582c.

Everything seems to work as expected and tests are fast again. Thanks for the discussion and the ideas!
