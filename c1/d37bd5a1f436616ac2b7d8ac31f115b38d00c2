Other possible fix is just change in form theme `collection_row` block without js editing (as I do in my project for now)
```
'data-num-items': form.children is empty ? 0 : max(form.children|keys),
```
to
```
'data-num-items': form.children is empty ? -1 : max(form.children|keys),
```

but "num items" should contain actual items count I think
