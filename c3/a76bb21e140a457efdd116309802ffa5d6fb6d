I can't understand why :confused: Those tests should be skipped for 2.3 version.

Well, it fails for the `--prefer-lowest` flagged build, because the mentioned commit has been introduced since `v2.3.33` version and up only.
Installed version of `symfony/http-kernel` is `v2.3.0` in Travis for this build.
