Why not in `removeEntity`?

@grachevko 1/ Because I forgot it ;) 2/ But actually I don't think this is useful because the form is here just to mitigate CSRF attack (thus I don't know why there is a form, a simple call to `crsf_token` in the view would be much simpler)

What about delete entity through form in which i can choose some deletion detail.
Like on delete product category select category to migrate products from deletable category? ;)
