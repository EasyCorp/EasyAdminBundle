There is no authorship on [EasyAdminTwigExtension](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/blob/add_phpdoc/Twig/EasyAdminTwigExtension.php)

@javiereguiluz If you want you can put "my" authorship in test classes, but being mentioned as a contributor is sufficient to me, having my names on classes is just a bonus :laughing:

@Pierstoval the thing is that Symfony doesn't allow to add `@author` on the classes related to tests. I'm sorry ... but I'll try to do something to compensate you :)
