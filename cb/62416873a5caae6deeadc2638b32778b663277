ok, so the fail is in the `$commandTester->execute([]);` method for some reason. I can't actually understand why.

I couldn't make the `execute()` method work ... but your test changes gave me an idea, so I updated your test and the issue is now gone ðŸ˜„   Also, we don't need the Maker bundle as a dependency. Our commands are called `make:...` but they are unrelated to the Maker bundle. We don't use it, we just name our commands the same for consistency.

Thanks again for your effort here trying to debug the issue ðŸ™‡
