Seems good to me, obviously needs a lot of testing, I'm gonna test your branch in my own backends in the next days to be sure everything works properly :)

@yceruto forget about the AppVeyor errors because they are broken (I just enabled the tests on Windows but I didn't look into the actual errors).

For the tests mentioned by @Pierstoval I'm planning to finish the [easy-admin-demo](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/easy-admin-demo) application to configure the remaining *-to-many Doctrine relations, so we can test a real application. But I can't work on that until the weekend.

I've updated the [EasyAdmin Demo application](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/easy-admin-demo) and tested this Pull Request changes. Everything works perfectly, both for one-to-many relations:

And for many-to-many:

I'd like to merge this as is ... and then improve the way relations are displayed in the `show` view.
