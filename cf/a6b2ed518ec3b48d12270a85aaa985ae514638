I tested it, and even though the feature I'd like to implement doesn't work (differenciate the entity and its DTO), it works generally ðŸ˜„

Is there a way to customize the form options differently between `edit` and `new`?

@Pierstoval you are right ... so I've made some changes to allow defining different options per form (by default, the same options are used for both).
