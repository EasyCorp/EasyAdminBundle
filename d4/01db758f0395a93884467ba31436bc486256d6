Thanks for this improvement!

About setting up things for testing ... I'd do it like this:

* Clone this repo in some dir (e.g. `/foo/ea`)
* Find one of your real Symfony apps which uses this bundle
* Make a symbolic link from the `vendor/easycorp/easyadmin-bundle/` dir of your app to the `/foo/ea` dir
* `rm -fr var/cache` and `php bin/console assets:install` in the app
* Now you can install Webpack in the other directory to make changes and rebuild assets:
  * Install `yarn`
  * Run `yarn install`
  * Run `yarn encore dev --watch`
* Now you can make changes in `/foo/ea` and you'll see them in your app.

This is usually easier than it may look at first. Cheers!
