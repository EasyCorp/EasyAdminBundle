:+1: It also allows to easily render tag elements as labels for instance, using pure css without changing the template.
However, I  would expect those items to be links to targeted entities. But it of course adds some complexity to this PR. :/

:+1: for @ogizanagi's proposal to add a link if the entity is managed by EasyAdmin

I did a quick test in 3a67a4c to add links. It works, but when I have some time I'd like to improve it:

There's no need to "improve" it actually: allowing to override what you provided is fairly enough :)

@Pierstoval but this is a common need for most people, right? I prefer to provided a built-in feature for that :smile:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What kind of features then?
I can't think of anything else than changing the `<ul>` for another tag, or adding a `class` attribute to it...

The code has been refactored to tackle the issues discussed by @yceruto.

I've finished this feature and (if test pass) I'll merge it soon. Last chance to review. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I think there is no problem with merge this PR for me, because the possibility of multiple administrations is not lost yet, just affects the link in lists. :+1: ?
