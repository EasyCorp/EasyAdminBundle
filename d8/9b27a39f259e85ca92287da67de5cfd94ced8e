@forsetius thanks a lot for updating this translation, specially considering how hard is to translate one of the messages. I loved your clever trick to make it a bit easier!

Regarding your question, I'm not a super expert in i18n, but I think that `]1, Inf]` is correct to say "any positive number higher than 1". In the Symfony Docs they use it too:
