At first this feature looked like "too much" for such a minor gain. However, I think that for some people it may be important to have this feature. I personally always change the favicon in the backend layout to better differentiate it from the public site. So I'm gonna merge it and after that I'll add the documentation. Thanks @ogizanagi for proposing and implementing this feature.
