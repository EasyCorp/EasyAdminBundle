Great work @Pierstoval ! :smile:
We could surely improve the directory structure, but I do not have any more relevant suggestion for now. :/

In fact, everything in the `Tests/AppBundleTest` directory is related to the bundled bundle dedicated to tests, and the others are to test the main functions of EasyAdmin. So here you can define your own "production-like" parameters to test the bundle *in situ* .

The `Tests/Controller` directory is only here to test the default behavior of the `AdminController` : check that the routes are properly executed (index, css, etc.). There should not be any entity-linked logic in there. Only configuration.

With the `environment` parameter in the different kernel methods in the `AbstractTestCase` class, you can specify different config files that will recreate the environment based on a real configuration, contrary to all the files we use to test only the `DependencyInjection` classes.

What do you think about this @javiereguiluz ?

@Pierstoval thank you for working on this. The work you've done is just fantastic! This is exactly what I wanted to do but I didn't know how to do it :)

I agree with @ogizanagi about the directory structure, but I guess it will just take a while to get used to it.

I'm going to merge this code as is and in the coming days I'm going to tweak some minor things (such as adding PHPdocs, adding a reference to the original repo where this code was copied from (https://github.com/Orbitale/CmsBundle), etc.) Anyway, I will be very busy until Wednesday, so I won't be able to work on it until then.
