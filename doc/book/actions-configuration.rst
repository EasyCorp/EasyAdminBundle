Chapter 7. Actions Configuration
================================

EasyAdmin backends consist of **views** and **actions**. The **view** is the
page where you are (``list``, ``edit``, ``show``, etc.) and the **action** is
what you do on that page (``search``, ``delete``, etc.)

Views include one or more **actions** to perform operations on the items
displayed in that view. For example, the default ``list`` view interface
includes four actions as buttons or links:

.. image:: ../images/easyadmin-list-view-actions.png
   :alt: List view interface

These are the built-in actions included by default in each view:

========  ===================================================
View      Default Actions
========  ===================================================
``list``  ``delete``, ``edit``, ``list``, ``new``, ``search``
``edit``  ``delete``, ``list``
``new``   ``list``
``show``  ``delete``, ``edit``, ``list``
========  ===================================================

In this chapter you'll learn how to enable, disable and customize these built-in
actions. If you want to create your own actions read the
:doc:`../tutorials/custom-actions` tutorial.

Disable Actions for Some or All Entities
----------------------------------------

Use the ``disabled_actions`` option to disable any action globally or just for
some entity. For example, to disable the ``show`` action for all entities:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        disabled_actions: ['show']
        # ...

When an action is disabled, the backend no longer displays it in any of the
views. Moreover, if some user tries to *hack* the URL to access to a disabled
action, they'll see a *Forbidden Action* error page.

The ``disabled_actions`` option can also be defined per entity. For example, to
disable the ``new`` action just for the ``User`` entity:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        entities:
            User:
                # ...
                disabled_actions: ['new']

The values of the ``disabled_actions`` options are merged in cascade for each
entity. If the backend configuration is the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        disabled_actions: ['show']
        # ...
        entities:
            User:
                # ...
                disabled_actions: ['new']

The ``User`` entity will have both the ``new`` and the ``show`` actions disabled.

Configure the Actions Displayed in Each View
--------------------------------------------

Adding Actions Globally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define the actions to display on each backend view using the ``actions`` option:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        edit:
            actions: ['show']
        list:
            actions: ['edit', 'search']
        # ...

The value of the ``actions`` option is merged with the default action
configuration for each view. In the above example, the ``edit`` view of all
entities will include the ``list``, ``delete`` and ``show`` actions (the first
two are the default actions and the last one is explicitly configured).

Removing Actions Globally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of adding new actions, sometimes you want to remove them. To do so, use
the same ``actions`` option but prefix each action name with a dash (``-``):

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        edit:
            actions: ['show', '-delete']
        list:
            actions: ['edit', 'search', '-delete']
        # ...

In the above example, the ``edit`` view will now include just the ``list`` and
the ``show`` actions because of the following configuration merge:

==================================  ====================
Configuration merge                 Actions
==================================  ====================
Default actions                     ``list``, ``delete``
Actions added by global config      ``show``
Actions deleted by global config    ``delete``
**Resulting actions for entities**  ``list``, ``show``
==================================  ====================

Adding Actions Per Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define the actions to add to each entity view using the ``actions`` option:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        entities:
            Invoice:
                list:
                    actions: ['show']
                # ...

The global ``action`` configuration (if any) is merged with the entity's
``action`` configuration, as explained in the next section.

Removing Actions Per Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define the actions to remove to each entity view using the ``actions`` option and
prefixing the action name with a dash (``-``):

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        entities:
            Customer:
                list:
                    actions: ['-search']
                # ...

The global ``action`` configuration (if any) is merged in cascade with the
entity's ``action`` configuration. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        list:
            actions: ['-edit']
        entities:
            Customer:
                list:
                    actions: ['-search']
                # ...
            Invoice:
                list:
                    actions: ['edit']
                # ...

This would be the configuration merging process for the ``Invoice`` entity:

================================  =======================================
Configuration merge               Actions
================================  =======================================
Default actions                   ``edit``, ``new``, ``search``, ``show``
Actions added by global config    (none)
Actions deleted by global config  ``edit``
Actions added by entity           ``edit``
Actions removed by entity         (none)
**Resulting actions for entity**  ``edit``, ``new``, ``search``, ``show``
================================  =======================================

This would be the configuration merging process for the ``Customer`` entity:

================================  =======================================
Configuration merge               Actions
================================  =======================================
Default actions                   ``edit``, ``new``, ``search``, ``show``
Actions added by global config    (none)
Actions deleted by global config  ``edit``
Actions added by entity           (none)
Actions removed by entity         ``search``
**Resulting actions for entity**  ``new``, ``show``
================================  =======================================

.. note::

    Beware that the ``actions`` option just defines if an action should be
    displayed or not, but it doesn't disable the action (a malicious user could
    *hack* the URL and change the ``action`` parameter manually). Use the
    ``disabled_actions`` options to ban those actions entirely.

Customizing the Actions Displayed in Each View
----------------------------------------------

In addition to adding or removing actions, you can also configure their
properties, such as their labels and icons. To do so, you must use the expanded
configuration format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        list:
            # shortcut configuration format
            actions: ['edit']

            # expanded configuration format
            actions:
                - { name: 'edit' }

Then, define any of the following options to customize the action:

* ``name``, this is the only mandatory option. You can freely choose this value,
  but it must be valid as a PHP method name (use characters, numbers and
  underscores only).
* ``label``, is the text displayed in the button or link associated with the
  action. If not defined, the action label is the *humanized* version of its
  ``name`` option. Set it to ``null`` or an empty string to hide it and only
  display the associated icon.
* ``title``, is the text used in the ``title`` HTML attribute of the ``<a>``
  element associated with the action. Most of the times you can safely ignore
  this option, but it's useful to display a helpful message when the action
  hides its label and only displays its icon.
* ``css_class``, is the CSS class or classes applied to the link or button used
  to render the action.
* ``icon``, is the name of the FontAwesome icon displayed next to the link or
  inside the button used to render the action. You don't have to include the
  ``fa-`` prefix of the icon name (e.g. to display the icon of a user, don't
  use ``fa fa-user`` or ``fa-user``; just use ``user``).
* ``target``, is the value of the ``target`` HTML attribute applied to the button
  or link associated with the action (e.g. ``_blank`` to open the action in a
  new browser tab/window).

Removing Action Labels and Displaying Just Icons
------------------------------------------------

By default, the actions showed in the ``list`` view only display their label
(``Edit``, ``Show``, etc.):

.. image:: ../images/easyadmin-listing-actions-label-only.png
   :alt: Action Labels in Entity Listing

Adding an icon for each action is as easy as defining their ``icon`` option:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        list:
            actions:
                - { name: 'show', icon: 'search' }
                - { name: 'edit', icon: 'pencil' }
        # ...

This configuration makes the entity listing looks as follow:

.. image:: ../images/easyadmin-listing-actions-label-and-icon.png
   :alt: Action Labels and Icons in Entity Listing

When displaying entities with lots of information, it may be useful to remove
the action label and display just their icons. To do so, define an empty string
for the ``label`` option or set its value to ``false``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        list:
            actions:
                - { name: 'show', icon: 'search', label: '' }
                - { name: 'edit', icon: 'pencil', label: '' }
                # if you prefer, set labels to false
                # - { name: 'show', icon: 'search', label: false }
                # - { name: 'edit', icon: 'pencil', label: false }
        # ...

This configuration makes the entity listing looks as follow:

.. image:: ../images/easyadmin-listing-actions-icon-only.png
   :alt: Action Icons in Entity Listing

Finally, when displaying only the action icon, it's useful to define the
``title`` attribute to display it when the user moves the cursor over the action
icon:

.. code-block:: yaml

    easy_admin:
        list:
            actions:
                - { name: 'show', icon: 'search', label: '', title: 'Search' }
                - { name: 'edit', icon: 'pencil', label: '', title: 'Edit' }
        # ...
