EasyAdmin
=========

`EasyAdmin`_ creates beautiful administration backends for your Symfony
applications. It's free, fast and fully documented.

If you already used previous EasyAdmin versions, beware that EasyAdmin 3 uses a
brand new architecture and it's incompatible with previous versions. However,
there's a command to :doc:`upgrade from EasyAdmin 2 to EasyAdmin 3 automatically </upgrade>`.
