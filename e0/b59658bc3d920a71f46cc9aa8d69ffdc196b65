Haha I use this sidebar style too

About the `overflow: hidden` and `position: fixed` problem I overrides dropdowns functionality making them absolute and following their item position on scroll

I'm not sure what is the best solution, but this works for me

That would be great! BTW. How you make such GIFs?

@ktrzos I make the GIFs with a free tool called LICEcap: http://www.cockos.com/licecap/

I've made some further tweaks to the sidebar. The changes are subtle but I think that the overall design is better now. As a bonus, the menu dividers are now displayed as straight separator lines when collapsing the sidebar:

| Sidebar normal | Sidebar collapsed
| --- | ---
| ![sidebar_normal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/14992950/dc5ba1d8-1168-11e6-8a73-7e54ba33cca9.png) | ![sidebar_compact](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/14992939/cec4045c-1168-11e6-8f77-619c2838e43e.png)
