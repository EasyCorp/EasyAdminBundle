👍 It'll be awesome, especially for translation stuff !

In my opinion this is useless in current realisation.
How validation will work? What if violations will be inside both tabs?
User will see only one, then submit form and then will see another?
How tabs well render on mobile devices?

In our project we use tabs for better navigation, but every tabs is a separated pages with it's own configuration in `easy_admin.yaml`.

I thought about the validation issue. One could add a special icon to a tab, which contains violations or a label to signalize violations.

@naitsirch That and you should always jump to the first tab that containing a validation error. This way you'll never see a tab containing no error, looking like the submission was successful.

I have extended the tab functionality to address the notes made by @grachevko and @iluuu1994.

Here's a screenshot:

If there's a tab with form violations, this tab is activated.

Any other objections?

Sorry for adding another *coding style fixing* commit, but I couldn't get phpunit and php-cs working for this project. Executing `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist` locally gave me

@naitsirch don't worry! I'll take a look at tests when I review this proposal. Thanks!

@fabpot Thanks for the catch. I've removed the superfluous trailing dots.

I would like to use form tabs, can I merge this pull request into my own EasyAdmin branch? Or will this be merged sometime soon in the main EasyAdmin repo?

@victorbstan Yes, of course you can ;-)

@javiereguiluz Would be nice if you could review this one soon.
