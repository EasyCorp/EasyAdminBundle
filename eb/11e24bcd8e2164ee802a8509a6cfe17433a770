Great ! Thanks for taking care of this ! My only concerns were about the fact this would be convenient for any nullable type. But for now, we only have the `datetime` type which is composed of multiple html inputs and wasn't very convenient to set to null quickly. So this is a perfect start.

About the label: What do you think about `Empty`, `Is empty` or `Set empty` ?

@ogizanagi I agree with you. I tried to make the code (ariable names, HTML classes, etc.) as future-proof as possible to improve this feature in the future.

About the label, I'm going to think about "empty". It's very human-friendly and easy to understand. Thanks!

I've updated the label to *"Leave empty"*:

And here it is in action:

@javiereguiluz : I think you can forget about my comments for now and merge this as it is. But we'll eventually encounter those issues later.

I've updated the code to display the `<select>` empty. I think this improves a lot the user experience. But I'd like to know your opinions. Thanks!

I think it is actually better for user experience and worse at the same time :laughing:
This is due to my concerns in https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/607#discussion_r46079545 but I like the `<select>` widgets being empty...or maybe it'll be better to hide all `<select>` widgets (without reseting them) ?
