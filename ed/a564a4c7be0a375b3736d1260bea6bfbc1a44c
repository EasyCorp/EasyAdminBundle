@javiereguiluz
- I added a redirect to referrer if not empty before trying to regenerate list route
- I updated to use the redirectToRoute shortcut instead of redirect
- For me, it can't be possible to have a referer param if list is disabled cause we're coming directly from menu, if I'm wrong, plz explain to me how it can be possible?
- I remove flash msgs and translations  :sweat:
