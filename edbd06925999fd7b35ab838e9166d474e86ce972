@javiereguiluz Sorry, I forgot this change in #174.

By the way, do you plan to run builds against different Symfony versions?

Thanks again for teaching me cool things about Travis.

I definitely would like to test against different Symfony versions, specially 2.3, which I don't use it but it's supposedly supported. But I don't know how to properly do it. Could you please help me with this? Thanks!

Sure, would you prefer a different PR or should I update here?

Maybe we can do it here to group all the Travis stuff in a single PR.

I pushed another commit. Let's wait for the Travis build to see if I made any mistakes.

Your method sounds a bit strange, why don't take example on [FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRest/blob/master/.travis.yml)'s travis file just by setting up env vars ?

@Pierstoval That approach ends up with a lot of more builds because each Symfony version would be used with each PHP version which would mean 28 builds (instead of 10).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Pierstoval at 2015-03-10T20:32:11Z

Yup but you would then cover all possibilities, which is better, isn't it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, I don't think it's worth it. You have to find a good balance between what you can do and what is good practice. The more jobs you generate the longer the build takes (in this case imho without adding much value).

@Pierstoval in this case I agree with @xabbuh: I think that 28 builds would be too much. And the good thing is that if in the future we face problems with some specific Symfony versions + PHP combination, we can easily add a new build to the list.
