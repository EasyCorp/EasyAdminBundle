@javiereguiluz Any idea why the build isn't finishing?

@iluuu1994 I don't know, but this is what I see on Insight website:

![insight-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/30026841-ebd76916-917e-11e7-8f86-b9cdd7e92038.png)

I've relaunched the analysis.

@javiereguiluz That's weird. It's also [not the only one that never finishes](https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/pull/1781#partial-pull-merging).

@javiereguiluz Are you still interested in this PR? Is so I'll have to rebase it to solve the conflicts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2017-09-16T10:09:27Z

Yes!! I'm really sorry but I'm still waiting for other peoples reviews. I needed to merge #1787 as soon as possible because it introduces massive changes and I don't want to break more pending PRs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iluuu1994 at 2017-09-16T10:10:44Z

Np, I'll wait until #1787 is merged then?

@javiereguiluz I do not need to add new files to the legacy folder, right? Since people referencing it should use the new namespace right away.

You are right. No need for legacy here.
