Altough I don't use turbo and stilumus (would love to see how this is benefittig you btw) I would opt for a solution to make it selectable.
Something like a ea.yaml or so
```
easyadmin:
     turbo: false
```

Stimulus organizes my JS code in a very nice fashion and is simply my framework of choice :smiley: it has benefits, it has drawbacks - just a choice you can make. Symfony UX initiative is built around it (one of the benefits for me) therefore we can expect it's usage within Symfony consumers to grow.

I don't think configuration option would be beneficial as it'd suggest that EasyAdmin is working well with Turbo enabled. It could lead to confusion as currently parts of EA are simply non-functional with Turbo enabled - parts of JavaScript code are not ran leading parts of front-end to be non-functional on any view caused by Turbo, not page load.

But I could easily add this as a config option - probably to dashboard configuration - if desired. I just don't think it is a good idea :)

I see your point. It depends on what EA will do with it in the (near) future. We let Javier decide
