There are some extra commits in your pull request (I've seen the same happened in other pull requests from you). Don't worry, this can be probably be fixed quickly.

There might be better ways of solving this, but something that helps me is the following:

* Browse your local fork directory and make sure you are in the branch of this PR: `git checkout translations-ro`
* Run this command: `git rebase -i HEAD~8`  An editor will open and you'll see the list of 8 commits of this PR
* Delete the lines that belong to all unwanted commits and leave only the real commit of this PR: `e0e7e10`
* Now I don't remember if you need to run `git commit -a` too ðŸ¤”
* Finally, run `git push -f origin`  to submit your changes ... the `-f` is mandatory because you have rebased, so you need to "force" the changes

Then, for future PRs ... you may need to run commands like `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master` or `git pull --rebase upstream` or something like that to update your local fork with the latest changes and avoid these unwanted commits.
