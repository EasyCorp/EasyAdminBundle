Updating flags is "a can of worms" that won't end well. So, I'm going to merge this PR because you spent time on it and it's clearly an improvement, but let's not update any other flag ourselves. Our flags are not realistic but a reinterpretation to allow displaying them at tiny sizes 🙏  If some flag is very wrong, let's report it to the upstream project that created the flags. Thanks!
