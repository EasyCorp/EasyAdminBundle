There is no need to provide missing translation IMO. It prevents using the translator local fallback.

First, @ogizanagi is right, and second, I don't see where `actions.add_another_item` is used :confused:

I removed the translatios that were not needed. Thanks for the advice.

The actions.add_another_item is in the form Resources/views/default/form.html.twig.
It is the link that add a row (a js action) when an entity has a oneToMany relationship.

Bly me I did not see the twig form template update.

Could you fix your commits so the user is linked to you on Github? It's better to show contributors in the eponym page :wink:

Great!
When @javiereguiluz's ready I think he can merge this.
