# TEST
# it's possible to remove custom batch actions at global level
# of course this makes no sense because at global level you only inherit the
# default actions defined by EasyAdmin, so you will never inherit a custom batch
# action and therefore, removing a custom action have no effect

# CONFIGURATION
easy_admin:
    list:
        batch_actions: ['-custom_batch_action']
    entities:
        Category:
            class: AppTestBundle\Entity\UnitTests\Category
