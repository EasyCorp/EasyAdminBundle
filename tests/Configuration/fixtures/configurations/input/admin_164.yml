# TEST
# entity actions add the same default batch actions as the global actions, but mixing
# different configuration formats (the result should not duplicate those actions)

# CONFIGURATION
easy_admin:
    list:
        batch_actions: ['delete']
    entities:
        Category:
            class: AppTestBundle\Entity\UnitTests\Category
