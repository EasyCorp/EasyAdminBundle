    message_string: 'The "this-property-does-not-exist" filter configured in the "list" view of the "Category" entity refers to a property called "this-property-does-not-exist" which is not defined in that entity. Set the "mapped" option to false if you are defining a filter that is not related to a property of that entity (this is needed for example when filtering by a property of a different entity which is related via a Doctrine association).'
